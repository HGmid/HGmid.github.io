Jan Murray works at a university as a student counsellor. Students can come and see her if they need any help or advice. I asked her when her office was open and what sort of problems students had.
I'm here every day during the week, and my colleague is here in the evenings and at weekends. There's also an emergency telephone number at night.
People come to me with all kinds of problems. A lot of them are worried about their studies and their exams, some want help with financial or legal problems, usually connected with renting flats and houses. Sometimes people want to talk about medical problems and for some reason don't want to see their doctor. The biggest problem though, is loneliness. Universities are exciting places, but a lot of students find it difficult to make friends. They miss their family and friends and feel lost in this new environment. My job is to listen and try to understand what they're feeling. But of course I also give practical advice when it's needed.
I've had two visits from students this morning. The first was a married student with a small child, and of course, she can't take her child to classes. She asked me  if I knew a good childcare center. Then a young man came in, and I asked him what the matter was. He told me that he was lonely and unhappy. He asked me if other students felt the same and he asked me where he could go to meet people. He seemed very upset.
